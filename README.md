## Introduction

In the world of heavy machinery, equipment downtime can result in significant financial losses. This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance system using AI models to anticipate equipment failures. The system leverages telematics data to provide actionable insights, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing the risk of unexpected breakdowns.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Predictions:** Custom AI models trained on telematics data to predict potential failures.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of equipment health, with immediate alerts for potential issues.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A sleek and intuitive frontend for easy interaction with the system.
- **Data Visualization:** A PowerBI dashboard for visualizing telematics data and predictive analysis results.
- **Integrated Analytics:** Flask backend for AI model processing and Next.js frontend for real-time prediction display.

## Architecture

The system is built using a combination of Flask for the backend, Next.js for the frontend, and PowerBI for data visualization. The AI model is trained on historical telematics data, and the predictions are integrated into the frontend for real-time display.
